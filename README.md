1. How to run your project:

   ```
   npm-install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. How much time you spent building the project
   4 hs (A few minutes more just to add the animation)

3. Any assumptions you made
   N/A

4. Any trade-offs you made
   I tried to add the arrows using a library. It didn't work as expected, so instead of showing arrows, I display the dependency system names under the details section.

5. Any special/unique features you added.
   Animation on search.
   More detail under the Details Panel
   App responsive. A little buggy in the filters section. I didn't have time to fix it.

6. Anything else you want us to know about
   I hope I understood the 'layout by data use' feature correctly. What I interpreted is that each column represents a data use, but this means that if a system has more than one data use, that system will appear in more than one column. My interpretation was that this was the requirement, and that's what I implemented.

7. Any feedback you have on this technical challenge: N/A
